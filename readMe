Instructions: 

Ensure that your process.hosts file contains one line per process using the format:
  <hostid> <hostname> <port>
For example:
  0 192.168.1.10 5000
  1 192.168.1.11 5001
  2 192.168.1.12 5002

Compile with a command such as:
  gcc -pthread bank_app.c distributed_mutex.c -o bank_app

Run one instance per host with the correct process ID and desired operation mode.
